# ALX Front-end Specialiation: ALX React

## Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly and confidently, without the help of external resources:

1. **Redux Connectors**

   - Understand what Redux connectors are and their purpose in connecting components to the Redux store.
   - Use connectors effectively to manage state and actions in your application.

2. **Functions Passed to a Connector**

   - Explain and implement `mapStateToProps` to map state from the Redux store to your component's props.
   - Utilize `mapDispatchToProps` to dispatch actions from your component.

3. **Mapping Action Creators**

   - Connect action creators to components using a connector.
   - Differentiate between synchronous and asynchronous action creators and their usage.

4. **Using Redux Thunk for Async Action Creators**

   - Understand the role of Redux Thunk middleware in handling asynchronous logic.
   - Map async action creators to components effectively using Redux Thunk.

5. **Redux Providers and Store Setup**

   - Explain what Redux Providers are and their importance in providing the store to your app.
   - Set up and configure the Redux store for your application.

6. **Improving Connector Performance with Reselect**

   - Learn how to use Reselect to create memoized selectors.
   - Optimize connector performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

7. **Debugging with Redux Dev Tools**
   - Use Redux DevTools to inspect and debug the state of your application.
   - Monitor state changes and dispatched actions in real-time.

## Features

- **State Management:** Implements Redux to manage the state of a React application.
- **Async Actions:** Demonstrates fetching data asynchronously with Redux Thunk.
- **Performance Optimization:** Uses Reselect for optimized state selection.
- **Debugging Tools:** Integrates Redux DevTools for enhanced debugging capabilities.
