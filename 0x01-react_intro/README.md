# React Intro

This guide provides an introduction to creating a basic JavaScript application using React. It covers how to set up a React project using `create-react-app`, an overview of JSX, debugging with React Developer Tools, testing with Enzyme’s shallow rendering, and configuring React with Webpack & Babel.

## Getting Started with Create React App

`create-react-app` is a tool that helps you set up a new React project quickly without having to configure complex build tools. Here's how to get started:

1. **Install `create-react-app` globally (optional):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

2. **Create a new React app:**
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This command will start the development server and open your new React app in the browser. The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source code.

## Understanding JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.

### Example:
```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

JSX is compiled into regular JavaScript objects by tools like Babel. This syntax is not mandatory in React but is widely used because of its readability and ease of use.

## Debugging with React Developer Tools

React Developer Tools is a Chrome and Firefox extension that provides a set of React-specific inspection capabilities.

### Key Features:
- **Component hierarchy:** View the structure of your React components.
- **Props and state:** Inspect and edit the props and state of your components.
- **Performance profiling:** Analyze the performance of your React application.

### Installation:
1. **Chrome:** [React Developer Tools - Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/)
2. **Firefox:** [React Developer Tools - Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

## Testing with Enzyme’s Shallow Rendering

Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React components' output.

### Shallow Rendering:
Shallow rendering renders only the component itself, not any of its child components. This is useful for unit testing and ensuring that your component behaves correctly in isolation.

### Example:
```javascript
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

test('renders without crashing', () => {
  shallow(<MyComponent />);
});
```

### Setup:
1. **Install Enzyme and the adapter for your React version:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16
   ```

2. **Configure Enzyme:**
   ```javascript
   import { configure } from 'enzyme';
   import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

   configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
   ```

## Using React with Webpack & Babel

For more control over your build process, you can use Webpack and Babel to set up your React project.

### Steps:
1. **Install Webpack and Babel:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
   ```

2. **Create a Webpack configuration file (`webpack.config.js`):**
   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   module.exports = {
     entry: './src/index.js',
     output: {
       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
       filename: 'bundle.js',
     },
     module: {
       rules: [
         {
           test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
           exclude: /node_modules/,
           use: 'babel-loader',
         },
       ],
     },
     resolve: {
       extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
     },
   };
   ```

3. **Create a Babel configuration file (`.babelrc`):**
   ```json
   {
     "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
   }
   ```

4. **Run Webpack:**
   ```bash
   npx webpack --mode development
   ```

This setup will bundle your React application using Webpack and transpile the code using Babel.
