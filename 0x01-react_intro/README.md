## Create a Basic React Application

To create a basic React application, you'll need to set up a React project, develop components, and manage state.

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js installed (>= 14.x)
- npm or yarn installed (npm comes with Node.js)

### Steps:

1. **Install `create-react-app` globally:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

2. Create a new React project:

   ```bash

   create-react-app my-react-app
   ```

3. Navigate into your project folder:

   ```bash

   cd my-react-app
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ````bash

       npm start
       ```

   Your application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
   ````

## Using create-react-app

create-react-app is a CLI tool that sets up a new React project with zero configuration. It handles setting up tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint for you.

### Features:

    Quick Start: Generates a project with pre-configured Webpack, Babel, and other dependencies.
    No Build Config: No need to manually configure build systems or transpilers.
    Hot Reloading: Automatically refreshes your browser on code changes.

### How to Use:

    Run the following command to create your project:

    ```bash

create-react-app my-app

````

To develop quickly, run the app with:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Understanding JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like syntax in your React components. It's transformed into JavaScript by Babel.
Example:

```jsx

function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

In the example above, <h1>Hello, World!</h1> is JSX, which will be compiled to React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!').

### Key Points:

    Embedding JavaScript: You can embed any valid JavaScript expression within JSX by using curly braces {}.
    JSX is not HTML: While it looks like HTML, JSX is syntactic sugar for React elements.

## Debugging with React Developer Tools

React Developer Tools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect and debug your React components directly in the browser's DevTools.
Steps to Install:

    For Chrome: Go to the Chrome Web Store and search for "React Developer Tools".
    For Firefox: Go to the Firefox Add-ons site and search for "React Developer Tools".
    Using React Dev Tools: Once installed, open your browser's DevTools, and you will see a new "React" tab for inspecting the React component tree.

## Testing with Enzyme's Shadow Rendering

Enzyme is a testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React components' output.
Steps to Install Enzyme:

```bash

npm install --save enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16
npm install --save-dev enzyme-to-json
```

### Example Test Using Shallow Rendering:

```jsx
import { shallow } from "enzyme";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

describe("MyComponent", () => {
  it("should render correctly", () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);
    expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

    Shallow Rendering: Renders the component without rendering child components, making it ideal for unit testing.

## Using React with Webpack & Babel

To use React with Webpack and Babel without create-react-app, follow these steps to set up a custom build environment.

### Install Dependencies:

```bash

npm install --save react react-dom
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react html-webpack-plugin
```

### Webpack Configuration (webpack.config.js):

```js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "bundle.js"
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./public/index.html"
    })
  ],
  devServer: {
    contentBase: "./dist"
  }
};
```

### Babel Configuration (.babelrc):

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

## Steps to Build and Run:

    Run the Webpack dev server:

    ```bash

npm run start

```

Build for Production:

```bash
npm run build
```
