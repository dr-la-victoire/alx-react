## Creating Basic React Components

In React, components are building blocks for the UI. You can create functional components using JavaScript functions. Here’s an example:

```jsx
import React from "react";

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

### Explanation:

- Functional components are just JavaScript functions that return JSX (HTML-like syntax).
- The `Greeting` component above returns a simple "Hello, world!" message.

## Reusing Components

One of React’s key strengths is the ability to reuse components. Once a component is defined, you can use it in multiple places within your application.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Greeting from "./Greeting";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
      <Greeting />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:

- In the example, we use the `Greeting` component twice. This is an effective way to avoid duplicating code.

## Passing Properties to Components

You can pass properties (props) to components to make them more dynamic. Props are passed as attributes when you use a component.

```jsx
import React from "react";

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Eleanor" />
      <Greeting name="Margaret" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:

- Here, the `Greeting` component accepts a `name` prop, allowing it to display different names dynamically.

## Defining Types for Components

To ensure your components receive the right types of props, you can use `PropTypes` (for JavaScript) or TypeScript for type safety.

### Using PropTypes in JavaScript

```jsx
import React from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

export default Greeting;
```

### Using TypeScript

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface GreetingProps {
  name: string;
}

const Greeting: React.FC<GreetingProps> = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
```

### Explanation:

- PropTypes and TypeScript both allow you to define the types of props your components expect, which helps catch errors early.

## Using React Fragments

React Fragments allow you to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

```jsx
import React from "react";

function GreetingList() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello, Eleanor!</h1>
      <h1>Hello, Margaret!</h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default GreetingList;
```

### Explanation:

- The empty tags (`<> </>`) are shorthand for `React.Fragment`. Fragments help avoid unnecessary wrapper elements in the DOM.

## Using Keys in Lists for Performance

When rendering lists in React, you should assign a `key` to each element to help React identify which items have changed. This improves the performance of lists.

```jsx
import React from "react";

function NameList({ names }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {names.map((name, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function App() {
  const names = ["Eleanor", "Margaret", "Alice"];
  return <NameList names={names} />;
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:

- React uses the `key` prop to optimize rendering by keeping track of which items have been added, removed, or changed. Always use a unique and stable key (like `id` if available) instead of an index, unless the list won’t be reordered.
