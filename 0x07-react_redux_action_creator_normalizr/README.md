## 1. Normalizr Purpose and How to Use It

**Normalizr** is used to simplify and flatten nested JSON data structures, making them easier to manage in applications.

### Example:

Nested JSON:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Post 1",
  "author": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Author 1"
  },
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": 3,
      "content": "Comment 1",
      "author": {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Author 2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
````

Using Normalizr:

```javascript
import { schema, normalize } from "normalizr";

// Define schemas
const author = new schema.Entity("authors");
const comment = new schema.Entity("comments", { author: author });
const post = new schema.Entity("posts", {
  author: author,
  comments: [comment]
});

const data = {
  /* nested JSON above */
};
const normalizedData = normalize(data, post);

console.log(normalizedData);
```

Result:

```javascript
{
  entities: {
    authors: {
      2: { id: 2, name: "Author 1" },
      4: { id: 4, name: "Author 2" }
    },
    comments: {
      3: { id: 3, content: "Comment 1", author: 4 }
    },
    posts: {
      1: { id: 1, title: "Post 1", author: 2, comments: [3] }
    }
  },
  result: 1
}
```

## 2. Schemas and Normalization of Nested JSON

**Schemas** are blueprints that define how nested data structures should be normalized.

- **Single schema**: `new schema.Entity('name')`
- **Nested schemas**: Combine schemas to handle relationships, e.g., `comments` inside a `post`.

## 3. Core Concepts of Redux

### Redux Core Concepts:

1. **Store**: The single source of truth for your app’s state.
2. **Actions**: Describe what happened in the app.
3. **Reducers**: Update the state based on the action.

### Example: Counter App

1. Define Actions:

```javascript
const increment = { type: "INCREMENT" };
const decrement = { type: "DECREMENT" };
```

2. Create a Reducer:

```javascript
function counterReducer(state = { count: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "DECREMENT":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

3. Create Store and Dispatch Actions:

```javascript
import { createStore } from "redux";

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));

store.dispatch(increment); // { count: 1 }
store.dispatch(decrement); // { count: 0 }
```

---

## 4. Redux Actions

**Actions** are plain objects with a `type` field:

```javascript
const loginAction = { type: "LOGIN", payload: { userId: 1 } };
```

---

## 5. Redux Action Creators

**Action Creators** are functions that return action objects:

```javascript
function login(userId) {
  return {
    type: "LOGIN",
    payload: { userId }
  };
}

store.dispatch(login(1));
```

---

## 6. Async Actions in Redux

For asynchronous tasks like API calls, middleware like **Redux Thunk** is used.

### Example:

1. Install Redux Thunk: `npm install redux-thunk`
2. Define an async action:

```javascript
function fetchPosts() {
  return async dispatch => {
    dispatch({ type: "FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST" });

    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
      );
      const posts = await response.json();
      dispatch({ type: "FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS", payload: posts });
    } catch (error) {
      dispatch({ type: "FETCH_POSTS_FAILURE", error });
    }
  };
}
```

3. Add Thunk to the Store:

```javascript
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import thunk from "redux-thunk";

const store = createStore(counterReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
store.dispatch(fetchPosts());
```

---

## 7. How to Write Tests for Redux

### Testing Actions:

Verify actions return the expected objects.

### Testing Reducers:

Ensure reducers update the state correctly:

```javascript
test("should increment count", () => {
  const state = { count: 0 };
  const action = { type: "INCREMENT" };
  const newState = counterReducer(state, action);
  expect(newState.count).toBe(1);
});
```

## 8. Prerequisite Topics for Further Study

To fully grasp these concepts, you may need to review:

- **JavaScript Basics**: Objects, functions, and ES6 features (arrow functions, destructuring).
- **React Basics**: Components, state, and props.
- **Middleware in Redux**: Understanding Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest, Mocha, or React Testing Library.
