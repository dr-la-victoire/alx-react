# Reducer and State Management Concepts

This project explores key concepts of state management within applications, focusing on reducers, immutability, normalization, and selectors. By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain the following:

## Purpose of a Reducer

A reducer is a pure function that determines changes to an application's state based on actions dispatched to it. Reducers:

- Take the current state and an action as inputs.
- Return a new state as output.
- Act as the foundation for predictable state transitions within the application.

## Why Reducers Should Stay Pure

A pure reducer ensures:

- **Predictability**: The same input always produces the same output, making it easier to test and debug.
- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Pure reducers enable tools like Redux DevTools to track state changes effectively.
- **Side-Effect-Free Execution**: By avoiding direct API calls or asynchronous code, reducers maintain clean, isolated logic.

## Why Mutations Should Not Happen in a Reducer

Mutations break the immutability principle and lead to:

- **Unexpected Behavior**: Components relying on state changes may not re-render correctly.
- **State Tracking Issues**: Changes made directly to the state bypass Redux's change-detection mechanisms, leading to bugs.
- **Loss of Historical State**: Mutations overwrite state, preventing access to previous versions during debugging or undo operations.

Instead, always return a new object or array representing the updated state.

## Using Immutable in a Reducer

[Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/) is a library that enforces immutability, providing structures like `Map`, `List`, and `Set`:

- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents accidental state mutations.
  - Optimized performance through structural sharing (minimizing memory usage for changes).
- **How to Use**:
  - Replace plain JavaScript objects/arrays in your state with Immutable.js collections.
  - Use `Immutable` methods for updates, ensuring a new state instance is created.

Example:

```javascript
import { Map } from "immutable";

const initialState = Map({ count: 0 });

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return state.update("count", count => count + 1);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```
## Using Normalizr in the App

Normalizr is a library for managing nested or relational data structures by normalizing them into flat objects.

   - **Benefits:**
    - Simplifies state management by storing data in a consistent format.
    - Reduces redundancy and makes updates easier.
    - **How to Use:**
        - Define schemas for your data.
        - Use normalize() to convert deeply nested responses into a normalized shape.

## Selectors: What They Are and When to Use Them

Selectors are functions used to retrieve specific data from the state.

    **Benefits:**
        Encapsulate state structure, abstracting complex queries.
        Improve reusability and composability in your code.
        Enhance performance by memoizing results (e.g., with libraries like Reselect).

    **When to Use:**
        To derive computed values from the state.
        To reduce code duplication across components.

Example:

```const selectUserById = (state, userId) => state.users[userId];

const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  user: selectUserById(state, ownProps.userId),
});```
